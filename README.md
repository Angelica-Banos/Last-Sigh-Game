## How to Play
Since the earth's atmosphere is broken beyond repair, you must place flower pots and plant flowers and trees in them in order to increase your oxygen levels, if your plants die or you remove them your oxygen levels *will* decrease.
- Use WASD to move.
- Press Q to place a flower pot.
- Press E to interact.
- Left-Click to attack.
### Features
- **If your oxygen level is over 200**, you can exit the greenhouse through the door on the top and go on an "Exploration" to different maps and collect seeds for your greenhouse.
- Plants take between 6-12 minutes in real time to grow, **keep them watered** even after they bloom.
- In order to skip time there is a bed on the right side of the greenhouse, **Beware that sleeping and going on expedition will dry your plants**.
- After your plants die a "bult" will remain on the pot, if a plant doesn't grow after a long time of watering it assume is dead and remove it.
## Known Errors
